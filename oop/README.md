# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practical Repository

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practical repository. This file contains multiple C++ programs demonstrating core OOP concepts. Each section includes a brief description and input-output examples for better understanding.

**Folder Structure:**  
The files are located in the `practicals/oop` folder.

## Table of Contents

1. [Number Operations](#1-number-operations)
2. [Grades Calculation](#2-grades-calculation)
3. [Employee Salary Management](#3-employee-salary-management)
4. [Personal Details Directory](#4-personal-details-directory)
5. [Name Formatter](#5-name-formatter)
6. [Fruit Management System](#6-fruit-management-system)
7. [User Validation](#7-user-validation)

## 1. Number Operations

**Description:**  
A menu-based program that performs operations like square, cube, square root, factorial, sum, and product of a number.

- **Concepts Used:** Loops, Switch Case, Mathematical Operations.

**Input Example:**
Enter a number: 5 Choose operation:

Square
Cube
Square Root
Factorial
Sum of digits
Product of digits Enter your choice: 1

**Output Example:**
Square of 5 is 25

## 2. Grades Calculation

**Description:**  
This program calculates the grade based on user input marks and validates that marks are between 0 and 100.

- **Concepts Used:** If-Else Ladder, Input Validation.

**Input Example:**
Enter marks: 87

markdown
Copy code

**Output Example:**
Grade: A

## 3. Employee Salary Management

**Description:**  
A program to manage employee salaries using classes, functions, and conditional statements. It calculates salary based on hours worked and adds incentives.

- **Concepts Used:** Class, Functions, Conditional Statements.

**Input Example:**
Enter hours worked per day: 8

markdown
Copy code

**Output Example:**
Salary with incentive: 30000

## 4. Personal Details Directory

**Description:**  
This program uses a Directory class to store and display personal details such as name, address, telephone, and mobile numbers.

- **Concepts Used:** Class, Arrays of Objects, Constructors.

**Input Example:**
Enter name: John Enter address: 123 Main St Enter telephone: 1234567890 Enter mobile: 9876543210

markdown
Copy code

**Output Example:**
Details saved successfully.

## 5. Name Formatter

**Description:**  
Formats a full name into initials followed by the last name (e.g., John David Doe becomes J. D. Doe).

- **Concepts Used:** String Handling, Substring Manipulation.

**Input Example:**
Enter full name: John David Doe

markdown
Copy code

**Output Example:**
Formatted Name: J. D. Doe

## 6. Fruit Management System

**Description:**  
Manages a fruit inventory using inheritance, with the base class `Fruit` inherited by the `Apples` and `Mangoes` classes.

- **Concepts Used:** Inheritance, Classes, Aggregation.

**Input Example:**
Enter number of Apples: 50 Enter number of Mangoes: 30

markdown
Copy code

**Output Example:**
Total Fruits: 80

yaml

## 7. User Validation

**Description:**  
Validates user details like age, income, city, and vehicle ownership using exception handling. Only valid users pass all checks.

- **Concepts Used:** Exception Handling, Input Validation.

**Input Example:**
Enter age: 25 Enter income: 60000 Enter city: Pune Do you own a 4-wheeler? (y/n): y

markdown
Copy code

**Output Example:**
User is valid.

## Conclusion

This repository showcases my thorough understanding of Object-Oriented Programming through C++ programs. Each program demonstrates a different OOP concept such as inheritance, encapsulation, and exception handling.
